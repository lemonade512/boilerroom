# Introduction
This is a template for a simple application that uses VueJS as the frontend web
framework and Flask as the backend server. I have tried to make the build as
simple and easy to understand as possible, but this also means that it doesn't
handle a lot of the more advanced usage that comes with the vue-cli setup that
is recommended by the vue documentation.

# Getting Started
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lemonade512/boilerroom.git
$ cd boilerroom/vue_flask
$ npm install
$ npx webpack --config build/webpack.conf.js
$ python run.py
```
